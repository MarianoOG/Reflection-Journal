This repository is an app to a systematic approach to understanding life, making better decisions, and continuously improving. It represents my journey of personal growth and philosophical exploration.

## Core Components

1. **Journal**
   - **Thoughts**: Capture thoughts based on questions that you create and challenge your assumptions, blind-spots and contradictions.
   - **Memories**: Free text entries about anecdotes, experiences and things you're thankful for and extract insights from them.
   - **Learning**: Capture your learnings from books, articles, videos, and podcasts and see how they connect to your life.
   
2. **Review System**
   - **Challenge Beliefs**: LLM-assisted questioning of your assumptions, blind-spots and contradictions.
   - **Generate Insights**: Generate unique perspectives on your thoughts based on your entries.
   - **Summarize and Consolidate**: Come back to a compacted version of your entries that you can consult and expand on.
   
3. **Visualization and Analysis**
   - **Mood Tracking**: Track your emotional state over time with data visualization.
   - **Resource Library**: Curated content on personal development and reflection techniques.
   - **Integration with Other Tools**: Connect with meditation apps, fitness trackers, etc.
